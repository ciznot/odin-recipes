    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>900 g (4-5) golden delicious apples</li>
        <li>15 g (1 tbsp) lemon juice</li>
        <li>50 g white sugar</li>
        <li>65 g brown sugar</li>
        <li>5 g (1 tsp) cinnamon</li>
        <li>1-2 g nutmeg</li>
        <li>15 g cornstarch</li>
        <li>15 g ice water</li>
        <li>226 g (2 sticks) cold butter, cut into slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350 g flour</li>
        <li>5 g salt</li>
        <li>30 g white sugar</li>
        <li>225 g butter</li>
        <li>50-100 ml ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and cut the apples into 1-2 inch strips</li>
        <li>Put the apples in a bowl and mix in the lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cornstarch and let it sit for 15 mins to release water</li>
        <li>Transfer the filling mixture to a sauce pan and reduce the liquid over medium to low heat for around 15 mins, stirring regularly, then turn off the gas</li>
        <li>While the filling is sitting / reducing, start the crust by putting the flour, salt, sugar, and pieces of butter in a food processor</li>
        <li>Run the food processor until it resembles a coarse sand (5-10 seconds) then start dripping in the ice water until the mixture starts to chunk together</li>
        <li>You’ll know when it’s done if you can pinch the dough with your hand and it sticks together</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F then start making the pie crust</li>
        <li>Cut the dough in half and roll both halves out with a rolling pin until they are big enough to cover your pie pan (around 9 inch diameter)</li>
        <li>Put the bottom half dough into the pie pan and cut off the excess dough with a knife</li>
        <li>Dump the sauce pan full of the filling into the pie pan and even it out</li>
        <li>Cover the pie filling with the top dough and fold over and tuck in the excess crust</li>
        <li>Use a fork or your fingers to pinch down the top crust to the bottom crust so you don't have air gaps</li>
        <li>Optionally you can now brush on the egg wash to make the crust get a shiny golden brown color when it cooks</li>
        <li>Cut a few slits in the top crust with a knife to give it a nice design and allow for air to release</li>
        <li>Bake 45 minutes at 350°F or until the crust is brown to your liking and the apples are bubbling inside</li>
    </ol>
