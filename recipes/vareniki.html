    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vareniki is a staple dish in Russian and Ukrainian cuisines. They are half-moon shaped dumplings that are boiled in salted water. Vareniki fillings may vary, but the most common version is the potato version. Depending on the filling, they can be served as a starter or as a dessert. It is customary to accompany varenieki with Russian sour cream called smetana.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18 ounces potatoes
        </li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda
        </li>
        <li>½ cup water
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup butter
        </li>
        <li>2 onions, finely diced
        </li>
        <li>3½ cups finely chopped button mushrooms
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and mash; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl while potatoes are cooking. Stir sour cream and baking soda together in a second bowl. Add water to flour mixture and blend in, followed by sour cream mixture. Knead into a smooth dough, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Add to mashed potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 portions and roll each portion into a 1 1/2-inch thick rope. Cut ropes into small 1/2-inch pieces. Press each dough piece into a small flat circle and place 1 teaspoon of potato filling in the center. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and seal edges.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add the vareniki in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 3 minutes. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a colander to drain.
